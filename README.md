## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Consultant, web developer, Expressen

My boss quit his former job and co-created this company.\
Since I appreciated him a lot I decided to join him.\
I continued my assignment at Expressen:

### Consultant, web developer, Expressen
**Dohi Innovation Agency, Stockholm,\
_May 2015 – October 2016_**

I was on a consultant interview at Expressen before my first official
day at Dohi and have been there since my employment was formally
started.

There has been a lot of restructuring of the development
teams at Expressen. I am currently in the Site team which
are responsible for almost every client facing microservice,
including the main site.

The work has an agile and test driven focus.

### Web developer
**Blocket.se, Stockholm\
_November 2007 – April 2015_**

I was initially hired as a back end developer. When the company
grew a separate front end team was created where my full potential
could be utilized.

During the fall of 2013 I, temporarily, became the team leader (TL)
for this team, due to the TL being on parental leave.  When he returned,
the TL role was split into two parts where one was responsible for
personnel handling and the other responsible for technical things. I was assigned
the latter role, in the form of senior developer/mentor.

The day to day work was performed in a Scrum-like way, with planning games,
retrospectives, continuous improvements and automated tests.

When we moved to a newly built office space in 2010 I got interested in
physical work environment questions. This was because I, and some of
my colleagues, found that the office lacked in some areas. From the fall of 2013
I was therefore one of the company's safety representatives.
